# BlockHub
 BlockHub is a decentralized version control system similar to (GitHub,GitLab,...).  
 
## Our Goal: 
 
 Gitcoin is a bug bounties platform for decentralized softwares but unfortunately they use GitHub a centralized app. 
 We intend to create our software for Gitcoin to earn your bounties by making pull-request. Pull-Requests get up-votes, 
 the contributor and the reviewer earn tokens for their help.
